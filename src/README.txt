- Each folder named after a chapter contains the source code for Pro Tomcat. 

- bin contains the WAR file of the web application. 
- lib contains the JSTL, which you will require when running some of the JSP examples. 
- The JSTL is also in the WAR file for convenience.

- If there are any chapter-specific instructions then a README is provided.
